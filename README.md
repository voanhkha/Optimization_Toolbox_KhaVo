The Optimization Toolbox by Kha Vo, including the following methods:

- Primal simplex for linear program (based on chaper 3, Linear and Nonlinear Programming, D. Luenberger).
- Length-constrained optimal segmentation (based on paper "Optimal Length-Constrained Segmentation and
Subject-Adaptive Learning for Real-time Arrhythmia Detection", Kha Vo, unpublished).
- Descend methods for quadratic program, including gradient, steepest and Newton method (with backtracking and exact line search),
(based on "Convex Optimization", S. Boyd).

For any problem with the usage of this toolbox or paper reference, please do not hesitate to contact Kha Vo via voanhkha@yahoo.com.
